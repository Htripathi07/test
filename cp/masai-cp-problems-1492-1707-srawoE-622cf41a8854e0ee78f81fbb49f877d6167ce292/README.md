# Problem statements

### Problem 1.  welcome message on home page [1]
- When we visit index/home display message as `Welcome to Books Wishlist !!!` 
- add this welcome text in index.html file in `h1` tag with `h1#Welcome`

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101581634/236438998-17f3c7be-4f31-411c-866b-bbada1bcf917.png" width="100%"/>

### Problem 2. List of books on dashboard page load [3]
On page `load`, a list of all `books` should be shown in the  `div#data-list-wrapper`. 

Expected markup (Book card list):
<!-- ![landing page markup]() -->
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101581634/236438143-0c838825-b162-41f2-9d08-d8f1d4c6935a.png" width="100%"/>

- The `div.card` is a card appended to the div with `div#data-list-wrapper` where all such cards are appended.

Expected markup (example single card div inside data-list-wrapper div): 
<!-- ![bookMarkUp]() -->
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101581634/236440244-b639cff9-e4a9-4dde-bdc8-ca95b8a7e4cb.png" width="100%"/>

**<span style="color: green">Markup - elements, classes & IDs should be identical to the above screenshot.</span>**

- The **Card** with `div.card` having two child div 
  1. The `div.card-image` in this image of the book is present.
     - you can choose any random url for image 
     - else use 
       `https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.uQlB7AC1-RNXr-jN512JTQHaGH&pid=Api&P=0`
  2. The `div.card-body` in this 
    - h4 tag with `h4.title` **with title of book**.
    - p tag with `p.author` with the author of the book
    - p tag with `p.category` with category of book
    - p tag with `p.publication_date` with the publication_date of a book
    - button with `button.card-button` with `Add to Wishlist` text 
        -  class= card-button

Expected UI (example card):
<!-- ![bookUI]() -->
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101581634/236441915-bcc152e5-c673-4b14-88b6-9f5692fb14a6.png" width="100%"/>

Data mapping:
<!-- ![dataMarkUp]() -->
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101581634/236443976-54d398f7-b1fe-455f-adc7-b5d4ff0a11cd.png" width="100%"/>

- *The data should be fetched from* `https://dbioz2ek0e.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/mockapi/get-books`

- Use <span style="color: red"> async await </span>to fetch data
 
- The books should be shown on page `load`

### Problem 3. Sorting Books Based on publication_date on dashboard page [ 2 +2 ]
- Sorting for `Newest First` UI:
<!-- ![sort Newest First] -->

With the click of the button `#newest-first`, the book list should be sorted as new books first based on their *publication_date*.

With the click of the button `#oldest-first`, the book list should be sorted as old book first based on their *publication_date*.

 You may sort the available data and make a new fetch request to the url and update the list.

 - param for Newest book list - `?sort=desc`
 - param for Oldest book list - `?sort=asc`


### Problem 4. Ability to add a Book to Wishlist [ 1 + 1 + 2]
- In each book, the card adds a button `Add to Wishlist` with `button.card-button` on clicking this button particular book is added to local Storage with key `wishlist`.

- Hint : `localStorage.setItem("wishlist", JSON.stringify(wishlistArray))`

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101581634/236447701-91d990cd-1fd8-4b4a-862e-4de3113ac308.png" width="100%"/>
